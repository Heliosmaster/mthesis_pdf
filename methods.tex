\chapter{Methods for splitting a matrix $A$ into $A_r$ and $A_c$} \label{chap:methods}

As described in Section \ref{sec:mediumgrain}, our main goal is to find efficient ways of splitting our original matrix $A$ into $A_r$ and $A_c$, and then use these in the medium-grain model.

Since we are interested in both improving the initial partitioning of $A$ and a fully iterative method, in the next sections we will discuss methods that can either take as input an unpartioned matrix or a partitioned one.

\section{Minimization of the empty rows of $A_r^T$} \label{sec:globalview}
\section{Assignment of rectangular clusters of nonzeros} \label{sec:sbd}
\section{Partial assignment of rows and columns} \label{sec:hot_restart}
