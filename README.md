# Iterative sparse matrix partitioning

This repository contains the material for my actual master thesis of the title _Iterative sparse matrix partitioning_.

The thesis is written in LaTeX, and `bieber` has been used as the BibLaTeX backend.

Some data for the plots (and the code to generate them) is contained in the `data/` folder.
